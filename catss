        <h2>Cat Care Tips</h2>
        <p>
            Taking care of a cat involves providing proper nutrition, grooming, and regular vet visits. 
            Make sure your cat has access to clean water and a balanced diet. Grooming needs vary by breed, 
            with long-haired cats requiring more frequent brushing. Regular checkups and vaccinations help 
            keep your feline healthy and happy.
